Heating rates are derived in clear-sky conditions, i.e. only in regions where total cloud cover is equal zero. (b) The heating rate differences between \"absorbing\" and \"scattering\" experiments are shown for 312\\,m grid spacing (orange) and 625\\,m grid spacing (blue). (c) Here, the SWH rate differences in clear-sky conditions are subtracted from SWH rate differences in certain cloudy conditions. Overcast (solid lines) refers to regions where total cloud cover averaged in 10 km sub-regions is larger than 95\\% and broken (clouds, dashed lines) refers to regions with intermediate total cloud cover values between 25 and 75\\% (again averaged in 10 km sub-regions).
